	Today I start a coding project from the odinproject lesson. It's been I think a year or two maybe since the last time I created 
	a genuine project. I'm kinda scared in making this project not because I don't think I can do it but instead because I feel
	like there's no way I'll actually stay commited on this project with all the distractions that I always easily fall into but
	I'm no quitter I complainer sure but a quitter? Oh heeeck nah. Anyway that's enough writing for today my challenge is to try
	to get as much done on this website as possible. I'll only be using chat gpt for the wordy parts of the website since I know
	next to nothing about cooking and while I do want to learn I want to focus my energy on the coding parts. Anyways enough
	self yap lets start.

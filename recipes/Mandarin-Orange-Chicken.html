                <p>If there is one meal on rotation in my house, it’s a bag of Mandarin Orange Chicken from Trader Joe’s. The same goes for thousands more that frequent Trader Joe’s.</p>

                <p>The simplicity of this dish allows any home cook to put dinner on the table. Whether you cook the chicken in the oven or in a skillet—or choose the method some of us at Allrecipes prefer, an air fryer—the meal will come out sweet and crispy in just minutes.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Customers love this product so much it was inducted into the Product Hall of Fame earlier this year. And even after 20 years, this freezer find routinely nabs a spot in the Trader Joe’s Customer Choice Awards for Best Entrée and Favorite Overall product.</p>

                <p>Is this item better than takeout? The answer is most certainly yes. But every time I cook this simple meal, I toss in a few extra ingredients that make it better than something you’d find in a restaurant.</p>

                <br>

                <h1>How To Make Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken Even Better</h1>


                <p>There are several ways to make this meal, but my preferred method of cooking requires a skillet or wok and a saucepan for the orange sauce. However, I hardly ever cook this dish with just the ingredients provided. Yes, many people—including myself—eat the crispy chicken over rice, veggies, or a bit of both. But in regards to the actual chicken, I always add a few extra ingredients to boost the flavor a little bit—and so should you.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Because this meal is so simple and doesn't need much to make it stellar, all you need is four ingredients: onions, garlic, soy sauce, and rice vinegar and the prep is almost as simple as the recommended method on the package. I just saute the onions and garlic in a little oil before adding in the chicken and cooking to get it hot and crispy. Then, I use the soy sauce and rice vinegar mixed with a little water to deglaze the pan and add a little extra flavor to the chicken. Toss the whole thing with the orange sauce and that's it—dinner is done!</p>
